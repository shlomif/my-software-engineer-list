# Social Studies

# Management and Planning

## Software Process Definitions
- [What is a Software Process Framework/Model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-software-process-framework/)
- [What is a Software Process?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process)

## Software Process Frameworks/Models

- Core Frameworks
  - [Waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) — a linear framework with strict phases.
  - [Iterative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_design) - a framework based on a cyclic process of prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining a product or process.
  - [Incremental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_build_model) — a framework of where a product is designed, implemented and tested incrementally (a little more is added each time) until the product is finished.
- Combined Frameworks (Many of these are quite similar in practice)
  - [Agile](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-agile-software-development/) — an iterative and incremental approach, that is flexible and adopts well to changes.
  - [Prototyping](https://www.guru99.com/software-engineering-prototyping-model.html) — an iterative and incremental framework that puts great focus on evolutionary prototyping. 
  - [Spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_model) — a risk-driven combined linear-iterative framework, that adopts elements from the incremental, waterfall and evolutionaly prototyping model.
  - [Rapid application development (RAD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development) — an iterative and incremental framework that pust a larger focus on being practical rather than using valuable time on planning, design, and documentation.
  - [Unified Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Process) — an agile software development process framework, with a heavy focus on UML.
  - [Evolutionary](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-evolutionary-model/) — an iterative and incremental framework, relavant for larger projects.

## Popular Software Process
- [SCRUM](https://www.scrumguides.org) - an agile process that works in concentrated chunks of time (sprints), and has well-defined roles for project members. 
- [Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban) - an agile process that relies heavily on the usage of a project board, and good communication.
- [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org) — an agile process that emphasized pair programming and customer satisfaction.
- [Rational Unified Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process) - a specific implementation of the Unified Process.



# Technical Knowledge

## Discrete Math
- [Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction](http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi2/dmoi.html) - An online book that covers all the subjects of Discrete Mathematics


## Algorithms
- [Geeksforgeeks: Fundamentals of Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/) — An online website that covers all the fundamentals of understanding algorithms.

### Search Algorithms

### Sort Algorithms

- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

## Software Metrics

- ABC Software Metric
- Balanced scorecard
- Bugs per line of code
- [Code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) — The degree to how much source code of a program that is covered by automated tests.
- [Cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)) — The degree to which the elements inside a module belong together.
- Comment density
- Connascent software components
- Constructive Cost Model
- [Coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)) — The degree of interdependence between software modules; a measure of how closely connected two routines or modules are; the strength of the relationships between modules.
- Cyclomatic complexity (McCabe's complexity)
- Defect density - defects found in a component
- Defect potential - expected number of defects in a particular component
- Defect removal rate
- DSQI (design structure quality index)
- Function Points and Automated Function Points, an Object Management Group standard[2]
- Halstead Complexity
- Instruction path length
- Maintainability index

## API Design

- [REpresentational State Transfer (REST)](https://restfulapi.net) — A stateless architecture for data transfer that is dependent on hypermedia.
- [gRPC](https://grpc.io) — A nimble and lightweight system for requesting data.
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) — An approach wherein the user defines the expected data and format of that data.
- [Webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) — Data updates to be served automatically, rather than requested.

## SOLID Principles

- [Single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) — A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.

- [Open–closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open–closed_principle) — “Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”

- [Liskov substitution principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle) — "Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.

- [Interface segregation principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle) — “Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.”

- [Dependency inversion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle) — One should “depend upon abstractions, not concretions.”
