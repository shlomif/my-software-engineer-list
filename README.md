# Computer Programming

## Programming Basics

### Data Types

### Variables

### Keywords

### Logical and Arithmetical Operators

### Conditions

### Loops

### Numbers, Characters and Arrays

### Functions

### Input and Output Operations

## Object-Oriented Programming

### Objects and Classes

- [Classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)) — an extensible program-code-template for creating objects.
- [Objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)) — a particular instance of a class

### The Three Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming

- [Encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)) — bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components.

- [Inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)) — a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class.

- [Polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)) — the provision of a single interface to entities of different types or the use of a single symbol to represent multiple different types.

### SOLID Principles

- [Single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) — A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.

- [Open–closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open–closed_principle) — “Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”

- [Liskov Substitution principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle) — “Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their sub types without altering the correctness of that program.” See also design by contract.

- [Interface segregation principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle) — “Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.”

- [Dependency inversion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle) — One should “depend upon abstractions, not concretions.”

## Component-Oriented Programming

### Component Characteristics

- **Part of a Whole** — Components can be composed to and decomposed from a system. Composition of an appropriate set of components should yield a complete functional system; decomposition of a complete system should yield the set of constituent components.
- **Component Ecosystem** — Components are designed to be used in a compositional way together with other components. A component is not normally designed in isolation, but as part of a collection of collaborating components. The collaborating components work in the context of a component framework governed by a component model. The collaborating components, the component framework, and the component model together form a component ecosystem.
- **Component Framework** — The component framework provides a common fabric or environment over which the components may be composed.
- **Component Model** — A component model defines what components are, how they can be constructed, how they can be composed, and how they can be deployed. The component model also defines the component framework.
- **Component Interfaces** — Each component specifies one or more interfaces through which other components can be composed with it. The interfaces adhere to the composition standards defined in the component model.
- **Provided and Required Interfaces** — One type of interface is meant for other components to compose with this component and make use of the functionality provided by this component. This type of interface is called a provided interface. Another type of interface is meant for other components to compose with this component and provide some functionality to this component. This type of interface is called a required interface. A component’s interface specifications include both the provided and required interfaces.
- **Component Compatibility** — Two components are said to be compatible if they have complementing interfaces (i.e., the provided interface of one component should be the same as the required interface of the other).
- **Implementation Independence** — Two compatible components (which have complementing interface specifications, by definition of compatibility) can always be composed, irrespective of the manner in which their interfaces are implemented.
- **Producer-Consumer Independence** — A component may be produced and consumed by different commercial entities, as long as the producer and consumer have a common interface definition for the component in context. This property of the component is a derivative of implementation independence.
- **Active and Passive Component** — During the composition process that composes components together, some participating components may be actively performing the composition, whereas the others may be passively participating in the composition process. Note that this notion of active and passive components is limited to the composition process; it does not imply that the passive components will continue to play a passive functional role in the resultant composite product.

### Defining Software Components

- **Function Libraries as Software Components** — a collection of functions packaged together, to form a function library, with an API. Cannot be resolved at Runtime.
- **Object Libraries as Software Components** — a collection of objects, that together form an object library, with an API. Can be resolved at Runtime.

### Elements of a Software Component

- **Component specifications** — documents the piece of functionality implemented by the component.
- **Component interfaces** — a set of accessible operations through one or more interfaces.
- **Component implementation(s)** — an implementation of the component specification.
- **Component model** — defines a standard socket to be implemented by the component framework, and a standard plug to be implemented by components.
